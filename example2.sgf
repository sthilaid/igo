AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, I'm Philipp from germany. Please forgive my amateurish english but i hope can understand me besides my bad english :)

You didn't make any big mistakes but some small mistakes that lost you the game. 
The main problem in this game was, that white, besides making some big overplays in the beginning, got everything he wanted. Try to fight more with your handicap-stones! You somehow ignored all fights and  it felt like you just always respondend to white. Try to fight back, so that white have to answer YOU.

Playing 10min sudden death is also crazy. If you want to play blitz, it's better to choose byo-yomi in my opinion. Improving from blitz-games is also quite hard, because you will settle your bad habbits by always playing the same mistake more often without noticing it.
Try to play slower games. I prefer 10min + 20-30 byo-yomi. That's not too long and not too fast. If you don't have the time for that, try to play some correspondence games on Dragongoserver.net .You can think about your moves as long as you like and  you can basically play everywhere with a smartphone if you download the dragongoserver-app.

I hope you enjoy my review. If you have any questions just write me an e-mail.]
PL[W];W[fc];B[jd];W[dc]C[hkk's favourite ploy against me; it tricked me many times until i looked it up in Kogo.  i may have misremembered the joseki, however...]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[de];W[bc]
(;B[ec]C[



P: This is just too early. You have to play c18! You said, that you checked already the variations so you already know your mistake. The result in the game was also ok, but black felt a bit clumsy.]
;W[cb];B[db];W[cc];B[ed]C[black feels happy

P: It's ok...i would be more happy with the variation i gave.]
;W[fb]C[black felt that white's move was a psychological ploy since white cannot connect and it makes white heavy.   but does black respond appropriately??

P: You have to connect e18, otherwise it was a succes all over the place for white here...]
;B[eb];W[fd]LB[fb:A][fd:B]C[P: A and B are way too early now! I dont know what whites plan is here. Just play solid and calm.]
;B[ce]C[this may not be the most efficient move for black - what do you think?

P: I think thats the right move here. White has to answer, otherwise the corner will die. You also enclose the left side in sente.]
;W[be];B[bf];W[af]C[yose during fuseki?

P: Yes, weird..]
(;B[bg];W[dg]C[P: Weird move again...];B[fe]C[P: That's the fighting spirit! Just connecting at c14 would be too slow.]
;W[ge];B[ff];W[hd]
(;B[dh];W[eg];B[fg];W[eh]C[i read in a book that pulling out weak stones is a beginner's error.  it is kikashi, forcing black to connect, so would have been a useful ko threat for later.  black is out on both sides, so expects profit from pressing an eyeless running group across the centre of the board.

however, alphago did a similar thing in game 2, so who knows?!  i sure don't.]
;B[cf]LB[cf:A][eg:1][eh:2]C[P: Now you connect anyway... But white got 1 and 2 and d12 is kinda weak now. Better ignore the exchange and connect at A immediately.]
;W[ch]C[what?! how should black respond?

P: Your move was nice!];B[cj];W[ef]C[black felt mocked by white since this only reduces white's liberties

P: Yes, strange...];B[ee];W[di];B[bh]C[black secures a connection.  white has 2 weakish groups.  game over - or it should have been.  so black must have blundered badly several times after this point to have lost by such a wide margin.]
;W[dk]
(;B[ck];W[dl]C[P: You push from behind here and make white stronger. Felt a bit too easy for white. It can't be good that you are already crawling on the 2nd line.]
;B[cl];W[ci];B[bi];W[dn];B[cm];W[cn];B[dm]C[questionable?

P: No, you have to cut here!];W[em];B[en];W[el];B[eo];W[cq]

(;B[cp]C[P: Wrong direction! Even if white can live in the corner you get nice influence on the lower side.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[bp]
(;B[bn]C[perhaps this was unnecessary?  its a yose move...

P: I think it was necessary, see variation.];W[bo]C[the corner was already alive.  black sees no merit in white's move]
;B[co]C[black should tenuki instead and play on centre right?]
;W[qf]C[pincer or extend?  there is some aji in white's left middle group, but not much; maybe best left as ko threat potential for later?

P: Everything was ok the way you played here.];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc]
C[too slow?  there are wide open spaces on the right and bottom

P: Normaly, white has to answer at R11. So it's not slow. I would have played like that too.]
;W[qn]
(;B[pj]C[P: This is a bit slack. You gave white too much space. Better to attack directly at R12!]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[pq];B[op];W[qr];B[qo];W[rq]C[i was conscious of q10 and wanted to help it.  there's not a lot of territory potential on the bottom, so i wanted to get some strength towards the right side.  did i find the right way?

P: Q10 is light. You don't have to worry about it.];B[rp];W[qq]
;B[po];W[rn]C[the same kind of move as f18.  if i could find a way in sente to protect q10, i might even be able to kill the corner?  at least, that was what i was thinking at the time, but now it looks to me that i was too worried about q10 as it has plenty of breathing space.]

(;B[ql]C[this is the first losing move, for sure.  i dont ask any questions from here on, but if you can identify a systemic weakness in my game, please tell me.  i know i'm not good at reading, but is there a correctable flaw in my overall approach?

P: That white got S5 here was way too good!];W[ro];B[qh];W[rc]

(;B[nq]C[P: What was your plan here? White is already alive in the corner.]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[rb]C[P: Now white is also alive with this group way too easy.]

(;B[nd];W[md];B[of];W[ke]LB[jd:B][nd:A]C[P: This was way too good for white now. A was way too slack...letting white cut B was the last big mistake. 
After that white is winning. This is also my last comment here.]
